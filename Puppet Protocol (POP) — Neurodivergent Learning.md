# Puppet Protocol (POP) — Neurodivergent Learning System

**Repository:** [github.com/obinexus/pop](https://github.com/obinexus/pop)

**Mission:**
Enable non-verbal or severely autistic children to **express themselves**, anchor identity development, and transmit learned guidance to peers, while ensuring human-centric safety and **plasma-coherent computation**.

---

## 1. Purpose

* **Identity Anchoring:** Each child has a **personalized puppet** reflecting their preferences, emotional state, and identity.
* **Guided Interaction:** Puppets enable safe interaction **without medication**, promoting **natural verbalization and social engagement**.
* **Generational Learning:** Children learn to **teach peers** through structured guidance anchored in the puppet.
* **Neurodivergent Accessibility:** Adapts to different cognitive stages and processing styles.

---

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Human-Centric First:** All system behaviors prioritize the **child’s development, safety, and emotional well-being**.
2. **Plasma-Coherence Compliance:**

   * All computational operations are built on **plasma coherence principles**.
   * Ensures **silent failure** and **resilient learning**, with natural stabilization mimicking plasma behavior.
3. **Error & Exception Handling:**

   * Dual-layer approach:

     * **Exception → next developmental stage** (learning from errors)
     * **Exception → fail silently** (no harm to child or environment)
4. **Stage-Based Risk Management:**

| Age Range | Severity Levels                   | Fault Tolerance         | Failure Mode                                                                                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–5       | Low, Low-Med, Med, Med-High, High | Warning, fault-tolerant | Silent-safe fail; plasma coherence prevents cognitive or emotional disruption                     |
| 6–11      | Low, Low-Med, Med, Med-High, High | Danger, fault-tolerant  | Silent-safe fail; panic safely in mind-space only, preserving learning continuity                 |
| 12–18     | Critical                          | Fault-tolerant          | Silent-safe fail; structured mental panic for problem-solving; ensures no real-world consequences |

## 3. System Architecture

1. **BCI Integration:**

   * Non-invasive EEG or equivalent input to monitor **intent, cognitive load, and engagement**.
   * Real-time **plasma-coherent feedback** guides puppet interaction.

2. **Plasma-Coherent Computation:**

   * Computational nodes behave like **plasma fields**: unstable when uninitialized, stable when naturally coherent.
   * Stabilization yields emergent properties like **reliable developmental phenomena** (e.g., lightning-bolt-like cognition bursts).

3. **Observer-Consumer Model:**

   * Each interaction is **observed by AI**, but decisions are **child-centered**, not machine-centric.
   * Exceptions are recorded and mapped to **next-stage learning**, not punitive measures.

4. **Generational Learning:**

   * Children can **teach other children** via structured puppet guidance.
   * All teaching follows **age-appropriate, stage-guided rules** to avoid cognitive overload.

---

## 4. Puppet Behavior

* **Identity Reflection:** Puppet mirrors child’s emotions, voice tone, and interaction style.
* **Guided Autonomy:** Child can manipulate puppet within **structured parameters** to explore learning safely.
* **Feedback Loop:**

  * Puppet receives **plasma-coherent signals** from AI.
  * Updates reflect **learning outcomes** and emotional stabilization.

---

## 5. Human-Centered Safety Features

* **Silent Failure:** All errors are handled **internally**, ensuring no emotional or cognitive harm.
* **Plasma Decoherence:** Errors trigger **controlled plasma decoherence**, acting as natural damping to prevent runaway states.
* **Stage-Appropriate Panic:** Cognitive stress is **contained within the plasma simulation**, never externalized.

---

## 6. Development Goals

1. Implement **fully plasma-coherent Puppet Protocol** for children 1–18.
2. Ensure **age-appropriate scaffolding** for cognitive, emotional, and social development.
3. Support **multi-child guidance** with observer-consumer learning framework.
4. Maintain **non-invasive BCI integration** for real-time monitoring and intervention.
5. Demonstrate emergent **reliable phenomena** (lightning-bolt-like learning events) under controlled plasma-coherent states.

---

## 7. Notes

* Plasma-coherent computation is the **core safety and emergent property engine**.
* All stages must maintain **silent failure behavior**, with dual-exception propagation only in controlled cognitive or developmental dimensions.
* This system **cannot and will not replace human guidance**, only **augment safe, structured learning**.
